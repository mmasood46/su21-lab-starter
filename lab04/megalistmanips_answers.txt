1.added save (sw) and restore (lw) operations for these registers to ensure their values are preserved.
2.Adjusted the array offset calculation to ensure proper indexing of array elements during the iteration.
3.Replaced the incorrect stack operations with the correct ones to avoid stack misalignment. 
4.Replaced the incorrect load operation with the correct one (la a0, 8(s0)). 	 	 	
5.Replaced the incorrect loading operation (lw a1, 0(s1)) with the correct one (mv a1, s1). 	
6.Adjusted the save and restore operations to properly handle stack registers (ra, s0, s1).
